I wanted a **minimal, animated link-in-bio** that I could easily host and update myself ‚Äî without relying on third-party services.

Here‚Äôs my process, tools, and what I learned along the way.

## How I Built It ‚Äî Step by Step

Here‚Äôs the **exact process** I followed to build this link-in-bio page:

### 1. Installed the environment

First, I set up a new Vite + React project:

```bash
npm create vite@latest link-in-bio -- --template react
cd link-in-bio
```

Then added my main dependencies:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer framer-motion
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

And configured Tailwind in tailwind.config.js + index.css.

### 2. Created the core components

Next, I broke the UI into small pieces:

- ProfileImage.jsx ‚Äî top image + profile info.
- LinkButton.jsx ‚Äî each animated link.
- SocialLinks.jsx ‚Äî optional social icon row.

Each component was styled with Tailwind utility classes.

### 3. Integrated animations with Framer Motion

I used Framer Motion for smooth interactions:
‚Ä¢ Added motion.a to each link so they scale on hover.
‚Ä¢ Wrapped the entire layout in a motion.div to add a fade-in on page load.

### 4. Added a Dark Mode Toggle

I created a simple ToggleDarkMode.jsx:

- Uses a state hook (useState) to switch between dark and light.
- Toggles a class on html or body so Tailwind‚Äôs dark: variants kick in.
- Wrapped the entire app in a parent div that smoothly transitions its background color using a Tailwind class like transition-colors duration-500.

Wrapped everything for a subtle effect

### Finally, I wrapped the main layout in a motion.div so that:

- On page mount, opacity animates in.
- On theme toggle, a scale or opacity change adds a gentle transition.

This subtle polish made the app feel more dynamic and fun to use.

## Why I Built It Myself

Most link-in-bio tools look the same and charge a subscription.  
I decided to build my own because:

- Ô∏è **Full control** ‚Äî Content, style, hosting, data.
- **Performance** ‚Äî Minimal footprint and blazing fast.
- **Custom animations** ‚Äî A unique style that matches my personal brand.

## Tech Stack

Here‚Äôs what I chose for the project:

- **Vite** ‚Äî Instant setup and super fast HMR.
- Ô∏è**React** ‚Äî Familiar component structure.
- **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äî Rapid, utility-first styles.
- **Framer Motion** ‚Äî Smooth page and hover animations.

## What I Learned

- Vite + Tailwind is a super productive combo ‚Äî zero setup pain.
- Framer Motion makes it effortless to add smooth, delightful animations.
- Self-hosting is the way to go ‚Äî full control and no recurring fees.
