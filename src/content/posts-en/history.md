## How It All Started

My story with technology began when I was a kid, sitting in front of my first computer and realizing that I could do much more than just consume content — I could **create**.

I started by tinkering with software, seeing what made it tick, and writing my first lines of code. Back then, I didn’t see it as a career — I was just curious and loved the feeling of making something real. That’s when I discovered that programming is a powerful tool for turning ideas into reality.

## The Pursuit of Freedom

When I started working on my own projects and with companies, I quickly realized I wanted more than a fixed schedule and a traditional office. To me, freedom means having control over my time, my environment, and the way I work.

That mindset led me to choose projects and collaborations that allow me to focus, be productive, and do my best work — whether that’s in my home office, a café, or anywhere that keeps me inspired. My laptop is my studio and my toolbox, and I’ve learned to adapt to different setups without losing sight of quality.

## The Influence of Minimalism and Japanese Aesthetics

In my work as a programmer and designer, I draw a lot of inspiration from Japanese aesthetics and their appreciation for well-thought-out details. I aim for everything to be simple, purposeful, and functional. To me, beauty lies in making something as straightforward as it can be — nothing less, nothing more.

Applying this concept to my projects allows me to focus on solving real problems, removing distractions, and putting the user experience above all else. Every product I build is a mix of creativity and technology, pragmatism and design.

## My Work and My Purpose

Today I work as a **Product Engineer**, and my role is a combination of coding, researching, iterating, testing — and most importantly — listening. I enjoy being part of teams that value quality, clear communication, and the pursuit of the best version of what we do.

Whether I’m building a web app from scratch, contributing to a UX overhaul, or shipping new features that improve a product, I always keep one question in mind:

> How do we make this better for the people who use it?

When I work with clients or startups, my goal is for things to be **clear and well-crafted**. I want every delivery to be solid, easy to understand, and to truly solve problems — not just add more code.

## What I’ve Learned Along the Way

- **Quality beats quantity.** A well-thought-out product is far more powerful than ten rushed ones.
- **Listening is key.** Before writing code or designing, you need to understand what people are trying to achieve.
- **Simplicity is hard to achieve — but it’s worth it.** Removing the unnecessary is the most difficult part of the process.
- **Adaptability is part of the game.** Staying flexible in different environments keeps me sharp and responsive.
- **Never stop learning.** Tech changes every day — and that’s the best part.

## What’s Next

I’m still learning, exploring new languages, new projects, and new places that inspire me. What never changes is my drive to build things that matter — things that are beautiful, useful, and built to last.

If you’ve read this far, thank you for joining me. I hope my story encourages you to live and work in your own way — and to create with purpose.
