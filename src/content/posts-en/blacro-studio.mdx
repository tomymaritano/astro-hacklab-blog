When the team at **Blacro Studio** reached out, I knew this was going to be more than just another website. They had a strong creative identity already — my job was to translate that into a smooth, high-performance web experience.

Here’s my process, the tools I chose, and what I learned along the way.

## How I Built It — Step by Step

Here’s the **exact process** I followed to build this site:

### 1. Set up the environment

First, I scaffolded the app with **Next.js** and installed Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest blacro-website
cd blacro-website
npm install tailwindcss framer-motion
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

And then I configured `tailwind.config.js` and added my global styles.

### 2. Designed components to fit the brand

Blacro Studio had its branding and assets ready.  
I split the UI into small pieces:

- `Header.jsx` — bold title section
- `AboutSection.jsx` — company story with animated text
- `ProjectCardCarousel.jsx` — marquee-style project carousel
- `ContactForm.jsx` — responsive contact form
- `Footer.jsx` — minimal footer with links

Each component was built using utility-first Tailwind classes to keep everything easy to customize.

### 3. Added smooth animations with Framer Motion

To add life to the UI:

- Wrapped key sections with `motion.div` for fade-ins on scroll.
- Added scale and opacity animations to links and images on hover.
- Built an infinite marquee for the project carousel.

### 4. Images and responsiveness

With `next/image`:

- Defined `sizes` and `fill` for responsive images.
- Kept the layout stable across all devices.
- Compressed images for faster load times without losing quality.

### 5. Backend & contact form

Created a simple `POST /api/contact` endpoint:

- Validated inputs with **Zod**.
- Sent emails with **Nodemailer**.
- Added basic feedback messages for successful and failed submissions.

## Why this setup works

This project matches my dev style — minimal boilerplate, high performance, and tailored to the client’s brand:

- ⚡ **Full control** — No generic templates.
- 🎨 **Custom design** — Every detail matches the brand.
- 🚀 **Performance-first** — Lazy-loading, optimization, and no bloat.

## Tech Stack

Here’s what powered the build:

- **Next.js** — SSR, routing, image optimization.
- **Tailwind CSS** — Rapid utility-first styles.
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations with minimal setup.
- **Nodemailer** — Reliable email delivery.

## What I Learned

- Aligning design and development is easier with early communication.
- Balancing visual flair with performance is key.
- Break the UI into small, reusable components to scale efficiently.
