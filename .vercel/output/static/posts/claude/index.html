Installed the environment\n\nFirst, I set up a new Vite + React project:\n\n```bash\nnpm create vite@latest link-in-bio -- --template react\ncd link-in-bio\n```\n\nThen added my main dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer framer-motion\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\nAnd configured Tailwind in tailwind.config.js + index.css.\n\n### 2. Created the core components\n\nNext, I broke the UI into small pieces:\n\n- ProfileImage.jsx — top image + profile info.\n- LinkButton.jsx — each animated link.\n- SocialLinks.jsx — optional social icon row.\n\nEach component was styled with Tailwind utility classes.\n\n### 3. Integrated animations with Framer Motion\n\nI used Framer Motion for smooth interactions:\n• Added motion.a to each link so they scale on hover.\n• Wrapped the entire layout in a motion.div to add a fade-in on page load.\n\n### 4. Added a Dark Mode Toggle\n\nI created a simple ToggleDarkMode.jsx:\n\n- Uses a state hook (useState) to switch between dark and light.\n- Toggles a class on html or body so Tailwind’s dark: variants kick in.\n- Wrapped the entire app in a parent div that smoothly transitions its background color using a Tailwind class like transition-colors duration-500.\n\nWrapped everything for a subtle effect\n\n### Finally, I wrapped the main layout in a motion.div so that:\n\n- On page mount, opacity animates in.\n- On theme toggle, a scale or opacity change adds a gentle transition.\n\nThis subtle polish made the app feel more dynamic and fun to use.\n\n---\n\n## Why I Built It Myself\n\nMost link-in-bio tools look the same and charge a subscription.  \nI decided to build my own because:\n\n- ️ **Full control** — Content, style, hosting, data.\n- **Performance** — Minimal footprint and blazing fast.\n- **Custom animations** — A unique style that matches my personal brand.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nHere’s what I chose for the project:\n\n- **Vite** — Instant setup and super fast HMR.\n- ️**React** — Familiar component structure.\n- **Tailwind CSS** — Rapid, utility-first styles.\n- **Framer Motion** — Smooth page and hover animations.\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned\n\n- Vite + Tailwind is a super productive combo — zero setup pain.\n- Framer Motion makes it effortless to add smooth, delightful animations.\n- Self-hosting is the way to go — full control and no recurring fees.\n\n#### That’s my process — if you want the source code or need help setting up your own link-in-bio page, let me know! 🚀&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/posts/link-bio.mdx&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;4e91fd14ee77abd4&quot;],&quot;deferredRender&quot;:[0,true],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;posts&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;link-bio&quot;],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;blacro-studio.mdx&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How I Built the Blacro Studio Website with Next.js, Tailwind CSS &amp; Framer Motion&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-06-24&quot;],&quot;excerpt&quot;:[0,&quot;Here’s the process of creating a minimalist, animated site for Blacro Studio — a creative agency — using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.&quot;],&quot;coverImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/images/blacro-studio.jpg&quot;]}],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;When the team at **Blacro Studio** reached out, I knew this was going to be more than just another website. They had a strong creative identity already — my job was to translate that into a smooth, high-performance web experience.\n\nHere’s my process, the tools I chose, and what I learned along the way.\n\n---\n\n![Design assets from the client](/images/blacro-studio.jpg)\n\n## How I Built It — Step by Step\n\nHere’s the **exact process** I followed to build this site:\n\n### 1. Set up the environment\n\nFirst, I scaffolded the app with **Next.js** and installed Tailwind CSS:\n\n```bash\nnpx create-next-app@latest blacro-website\ncd blacro-website\nnpm install tailwindcss framer-motion\nnpx tailwindcss init -p\n```\n\nAnd then I configured `tailwind.config.js` and added my global styles.\n\n### 2. Designed components to fit the brand\n\nBlacro Studio had its branding and assets ready.  \nI split the UI into small pieces:\n\n- `Header.jsx` — bold title section\n- `AboutSection.jsx` — company story with animated text\n- `ProjectCardCarousel.jsx` — marquee-style project carousel\n- `ContactForm.jsx` — responsive contact form\n- `Footer.jsx` — minimal footer with links\n\nEach component was built using utility-first Tailwind classes to keep everything easy to customize.\n\n### 3. Added smooth animations with Framer Motion\n\nTo add life to the UI:\n\n- Wrapped key sections with `motion.div` for fade-ins on scroll.\n- Added scale and opacity animations to links and images on hover.\n- Built an infinite marquee for the project carousel.\n\n### 4. Images and responsiveness\n\nWith `next/image`:\n\n- Defined `sizes` and `fill` for responsive images.\n- Kept the layout stable across all devices.\n- Compressed images for faster load times without losing quality.\n\n### 5. Backend &amp; contact form\n\nCreated a simple `POST /api/contact` endpoint:\n\n- Validated inputs with **Zod**.\n- Sent emails with **Nodemailer**.\n- Added basic feedback messages for successful and failed submissions.\n\n---\n\n## Why this setup works\n\nThis project matches my dev style — minimal boilerplate, high performance, and tailored to the client’s brand:\n\n- ⚡ **Full control** — No generic templates.\n- 🎨 **Custom design** — Every detail matches the brand.\n- 🚀 **Performance-first** — Lazy-loading, optimization, and no bloat.\n\n---\n\n## Tech Stack\n\nHere’s what powered the build:\n\n- **Next.js** — SSR, routing, image optimization.\n- **Tailwind CSS** — Rapid utility-first styles.\n- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations with minimal setup.\n- **Nodemailer** — Reliable email delivery.\n\n---\n\n## What I Learned\n\n- Aligning design and development is easier with early communication.\n- Balancing visual flair with performance is key.\n- Break the UI into small, reusable components to scale efficiently.\n\n#### That’s my process — if you’d like the source code or help creating your own branded site, reach out! ✌️&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/posts/blacro-studio.mdx&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;5cc336eac69256e5&quot;],&quot;deferredRender&quot;:[0,true],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;posts&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;blacro-studio&quot;],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;history.md&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;My Journey: From Coding at Home to Creating on My Own Terms&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-04-01&quot;],&quot;excerpt&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m Tomy, a developer and product engineer who has made flexibility, minimalism, and thoughtful work my way of life.&quot;],&quot;coverImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/images/myjourney.jpg&quot;]}],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;## How It All Started\n\nMy story with technology began when I was a kid, sitting in front of my first computer and realizing that I could do much more than just consume content — I could **create**.\n\nI started by tinkering with software, seeing what made it tick, and writing my first lines of code. Back then, I didn’t see it as a career — I was just curious and loved the feeling of making something real. That’s when I discovered that programming is a powerful tool for turning ideas into reality.\n\n## The Pursuit of Freedom\n\nWhen I started working on my own projects and with companies, I quickly realized I wanted more than a fixed schedule and a traditional office. To me, freedom means having control over my time, my environment, and the way I work.\n\nThat mindset led me to choose projects and collaborations that allow me to focus, be productive, and do my best work — whether that’s in my home office, a café, or anywhere that keeps me inspired. My laptop is my studio and my toolbox, and I’ve learned to adapt to different setups without losing sight of quality.\n\n![My workspace on the go](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523726491678-bf852e717f6a?q=80&amp;w=1740&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\n\n## The Influence of Minimalism and Japanese Aesthetics\n\nIn my work as a programmer and designer, I draw a lot of inspiration from Japanese aesthetics and their appreciation for well-thought-out details. I aim for everything to be simple, purposeful, and functional. To me, beauty lies in making something as straightforward as it can be — nothing less, nothing more.\n\nApplying this concept to my projects allows me to focus on solving real problems, removing distractions, and putting the user experience above all else. Every product I build is a mix of creativity and technology, pragmatism and design.\n\n## My Work and My Purpose\n\nToday I work as a **Product Engineer**, and my role is a combination of coding, researching, iterating, testing — and most importantly — listening. I enjoy being part of teams that value quality, clear communication, and the pursuit of the best version of what we do.\n\nWhether I’m building a web app from scratch, contributing to a UX overhaul, or shipping new features that improve a product, I always keep one question in mind:\n\n&gt; How do we make this better for the people who use it?\n\nWhen I work with clients or startups, my goal is for things to be **clear and well-crafted**. I want every delivery to be solid, easy to understand, and to truly solve problems — not just add more code.\n\n## What I’ve Learned Along the Way\n\n- **Quality beats quantity.** A well-thought-out product is far more powerful than ten rushed ones.\n- **Listening is key.** Before writing code or designing, you need to understand what people are trying to achieve.\n- **Simplicity is hard to achieve — but it’s worth it.** Removing the unnecessary is the most difficult part of the process.\n- **Adaptability is part of the game.** Staying flexible in different environments keeps me sharp and responsive.\n- **Never stop learning.** Tech changes every day — and that’s the best part.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nI’m still learning, exploring new languages, new projects, and new places that inspire me. What never changes is my drive to build things that matter — things that are beautiful, useful, and built to last.\n\nIf you’ve read this far, thank you for joining me. I hope my story encourages you to live and work in your own way — and to create with purpose.\n\n![My workspace on the go](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1690228254548-31ef53e40cd1?q=80&amp;w=1142&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D)\n\n**— Tomy**&quot;],&quot;filePath&quot;:[0,&quot;src/content/posts/history.md&quot;],&quot;digest&quot;:[0,&quot;9cbb3918f4ca2005&quot;],&quot;rendered&quot;:[0,{&quot;html&quot;:[0,&quot;&lt;h2 id=\&quot;how-it-all-started\&quot;&gt;How It All Started&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My story with technology began when I was a kid, sitting in front of my first computer and realizing that I could do much more than just consume content — I could &lt;strong&gt;create&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I started by tinkering with software, seeing what made it tick, and writing my first lines of code.

I want every delivery to be solid, easy to understand, and to truly solve problems — not just add more code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=\&quot;what-ive-learned-along-the-way\&quot;&gt;What I’ve Learned Along the Way&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality beats quantity.&lt;/strong&gt; A well-thought-out product is far more powerful than ten rushed ones.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening is key.&lt;/strong&gt; Before writing code or designing, you need to understand what people are trying to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity is hard to achieve — but it’s worth it.&lt;/strong&gt; Removing the unnecessary is the most difficult part of the process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability is part of the game.&lt;/strong&gt; Staying flexible in different environments keeps me sharp and responsive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never stop learning.&lt;/strong&gt; Tech changes every day — and that’s the best part.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 id=\&quot;whats-next\&quot;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning, exploring new languages, new projects, and new places that inspire me. What never changes is my drive to build things that matter — things that are beautiful, useful, and built to last.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read this far, thank you for joining me. I hope my story encourages you to live and work in your own way — and to create with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1690228254548-31ef53e40cd1?q=80&amp;#x26;w=1142&amp;#x26;auto=format&amp;#x26;fit=crop&amp;#x26;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;#x26;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D\&quot; alt=\&quot;My workspace on the go\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— Tomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;metadata&quot;:[0,{&quot;headings&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;how-it-all-started&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;How It All Started&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-pursuit-of-freedom&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Pursuit of Freedom&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;the-influence-of-minimalism-and-japanese-aesthetics&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Influence of Minimalism and Japanese Aesthetics&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;my-work-and-my-purpose&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;My Work and My Purpose&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;what-ive-learned-along-the-way&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What I’ve Learned Along the Way&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;depth&quot;:[0,2],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;whats-next&quot;],&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;What’s Next&quot;]}]]],&quot;localImagePaths&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;remoteImagePaths&quot;:[1,[]],&quot;frontmatter&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;My Journey: From Coding at Home to Creating on My Own Terms&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-04-01&quot;],&quot;excerpt&quot;:[0,&quot;I’m Tomy, a developer and product engineer who has made flexibility, minimalism, and thoughtful work my way of life.&quot;],&quot;coverImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/images/myjourney.jpg&quot;]}],&quot;imagePaths&quot;:[1,[]]}]}],&quot;collection&quot;:[0,&quot;posts&quot;],&quot;slug&quot;:[0,&quot;history&quot;],&quot;render&quot;:[0,null]}],[0,{&quot;id&quot;:[0,&quot;astro-blog.md&quot;],&quot;data&quot;:[0,{&quot;title&quot;:[0,&quot;How I Built My Blog with Astro: My Step-by-Step Process&quot;],&quot;date&quot;:[0,&quot;2025-06-02&quot;],&quot;excerpt&quot;:[0,&quot;Here’s the full story of how I rebuilt my blog with Astro — including all the tools, NPM packages, and lessons learned along the way.&quot;],&quot;coverImage&quot;:[0,&quot;/images/astro.jpg&quot;]}],&quot;body&quot;:[0,&quot;I recently rebuilt my personal blog using **[Astro](https://astro.build)**, and I want to share the whole process — from the first `npx create astro@latest` to the NPM packages and components that make it work.\n\nIf you’re looking to do something similar, I hope this guide gives you a clear roadmap. ⚡\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhen I decided to redo my blog, my goals were clear:\n\n- **Fast and lightweight**\n- **Focus on writing content**\n- **No complicated CMS — just Markdown files**\n- **Easy to host, scale, and maintain**\n\nThat’s why I picked **Astro** — it’s perfect for this kind of project.\n\n---\n\n## Initial Setup\n\nHere’s what I ran to get going:\n\n```bash\n# Create a new Astro project\nnpx create astro@latest my-blog\ncd my-blog\n\n# Add Tailwind CSS for quick styling\nnpx astro add tailwind\n```\n\nWhy Tailwind?\nNo custom CSS boilerplate, just utility classes and I can focus on layout without writing repetitive CSS.\n\n## NPM Packages I Installed\n\n```bash\nastro — Core framework.\n@astrojs/tailwind — Easy utility-first styles.\n@astrojs/mdx — Support for writing posts and components in MDX.\n@astrojs/rss — RSS feed generation for my blog.\ndate-fns — Formatting dates in posts.\nrecharts — Interactive graphs.\nastrojs/image — Optimized image handling`\n\nnpm install @astrojs/mdx @astrojs/rss date-fns recharts\n```\n\n## ✍️ Writing Content\n\nAstro makes content super easy.

<p><em>Claude Code in action: complete app dev from the terminal</em></p>
<p><strong>What fascinates me</strong>: You write your idea in plain English and Claude Code generates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete applications</li>
<li>Built-in tests</li>
<li>Best practices by default</li>
<li>Clean documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s like having a senior dev that never sleeps.</p>

<p><strong>Plot twist</strong>: Proper planning saves months of pivoting.</p>
<p>Claude showed me that before writing code I need:</p>
<ol>
<li>✅ Proper legal structure (for protection)</li>
<li>✅ Required sector permits</li>
<li>✅ Civil liability insurance</li>
<li>✅ Pilot customer validation</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Code is easy. Business is complex.</strong></p>
